# CALI
Comprehensive Asset Library Initiative

Rules of the project:
1. Contains unedited Paradox icons for now due to asset harvesting process - do not abuse.
2. Please sort your assets properly. Be nice and break them into components as well.
3. This library is public, if you don't want your assets to be used publicly, don't upload them.
4. If you wish to be credited, upload a text file along with your assets, listing the filenames you contributed
5. Don't be a dick and take credit for others' art.
6. PNG is preferred, TGA is also acceptable. Please don't use DDS - terrible lossy format.
7. DO NOT UPLOAD ICONS YOU DID NOT MAKE YOURSELF.

Project Goals:
- Assemble comprehensive library of assets to be used in HOI4 focus/idea icons
- Make modding focus/idea icons a simple affair involving copy/pasting existing assets

Please use responsibly.
